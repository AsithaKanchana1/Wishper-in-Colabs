# Whisper Transcription Project

This project demonstrates how to use **OpenAI's Whisper** model to transcribe audio and video files using **Google Colab**. Whisper provides accurate speech-to-text transcription for a wide range of audio formats and languages.

---

## üöÄ Features
- **Easy-to-use** transcription pipeline in Google Colab.
- **Support for multiple languages**.
- Transcribe **audio and video files** using Whisper models.
- Output transcriptions in `.txt` or `.srt` and other populer formats.

---

## üìù Instructions

### Step 1: Open Google Colab
Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and create a new notebook.

### Step 2: Change Runtime Type to GPU
- Click on **Runtime** in the top menu.
- Select **Change runtime type**.
- Set **Hardware accelerator** to **GPU** and click **Save**. This allows Whisper to run faster.

### Step 3: Install Whisper and Dependencies
In the first cell of the notebook, run the following commands to install Whisper and the required dependencies:

```bash
!pip install git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git
!sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg

```

### Step 4: Upload Your Audio or Video File
- Upload your file by navigating to the **Files** tab in Colab.
- Click on **Upload** to select your audio or video file from your local system.

## üìã How to Upload and Access Files from Google Drive

If you want to upload and access your audio/video files from **Google Drive** in Google Colab, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Set File Permissions in Google Drive
1. Go to your **Google Drive**.
2. Right-click on the file you want to use.
3. Select **Get link**.
4. In the "Get Link" section, change the file's permissions to **Restricted** and make sure it is set to **Anyone with the link**.

### Step 2: Copy the File ID
- Copy the file ID from the URL. The file ID is the long string of characters that comes after `d/` in the URL. For example, in the following URL:

[Demo File URL](https://drive.google.com/file/d/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/view?usp=sharing)


The **file ID** is: `xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`.

### Step 3: Download the File in Colab
1. Open your **Google Colab** notebook.
2. Run the following command to download the file using **gdown**:

  ```bash
  !gdown --id xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
  ```

  Replace `xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` with the actual file ID you copied in Step 2.


### Step 5: Run Whisper for Transcription
Run the following code in a new Colab cell to transcribe your uploaded file:

```bash
!whisper "YOUR_FILE_NAME" --model medium

```

### Step 6: Download the Transcription Files
After Whisper completes the transcription, you will find `.txt` and `.srt` files in the Colab environment. To download these files:
- Right-click on the file.
- Select **Download** from the context menu to save the transcription files to your local system.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings and Important Notes

- **Privacy**: Be cautious when uploading sensitive or confidential audio and video files to cloud services like Google Colab. Always ensure that the data you upload is safe and within your privacy requirements.
- **Model Limitations**: Whisper's transcription accuracy may vary depending on the quality of the audio and background noise. It works best with clear, high-quality audio recordings. Noisy or distorted audio may result in inaccurate transcriptions.
- **Large Files**: Transcribing large video or audio files can take a significant amount of time and computational resources. Please be patient while the transcription is being processed.
- **GPU Usage**: Google Colab's free-tier GPU usage is limited, and long-running tasks might be interrupted. For better performance and fewer interruptions, consider upgrading to **Colab Pro**.

## üí° Additional Information
- You can modify the model to use different sizes (e.g., `small`, `medium`, `large`) based on your needs for speed vs. accuracy. Larger models (like `large`) provide better accuracy, but may require more computational resources.
- Whisper supports a variety of languages. For a full list of supported languages and additional features, check out the [Whisper documentation](https://github.com/openai/whisper).
